h1. UQRota

UQRota is really two projects -- the first is to develop a system that crawls and indexes lots of information about courses and timetables at UQ and presents it in a machine-readable and convenient form. This part is the Rota API. The second aspect of the project is developing and maintaining a frontend for the Rota API written in Javascript and running on most modern web browsers.

This repository holds the working code for the next version of UQRota, not yet deployed to the live server.

h2. Information that Rota tracks
